# About

I live near a park that was always empty. At the same time, I noticed people in my neighborhood struggling to find ways to connect casually. This contrast sparked the idea. After a bit of research online, I found out that parks, libraries, and other urban spaces often drain taxpayer money but sit mostly empty. On top of that, Digital isolation has gutted casual social bonds, leaving people lonelier than ever. Even finding a spot or planning a small meetup is absurdly difficult.

In a lot of cases, urban planning often treats public spaces as static infrastructure rather than places for real community life. Zoning and car-focused layouts isolate neighborhoods, making casual interaction harder. I wanted to build something that would make our shared spaces feel alive again.

CommonGround helps people find and use public spaces, parks and libraries in real-time. It shows what's available and makes it easy to organize casual meetups, events, etc turning empty spaces into community hubs.

Another Important thing it does is that the platform naturally creates value by driving more activity to public assets, which opens up natural opportunities like partnerships with cities for management tools and  even local businesses wanting to reach engaged community members.

### 1. Market & Revenue

CommonGround monetizes civic infrastructure by transforming underutilized public spaces into engines of engagement and commerce.

* **B2B SaaS Subscriptions**: Annual licenses for cities and universities for analytics and management tools.
* **Transaction Fees**: Minimal processing fee on paid events and ticketing through our platform.
* **Local Commerce Partnerships**: Revenue share from "proximity" promotions with local businesses.
* **Data Insights (Anonymized)**: Selling aggregated space utilization trends to urban planners and developers.

---

### 2. The Problem

Public spaces and community life are constrained by three critical inefficiencies:

* **Inefficient Resource Use**: Parks, libraries, and civic spaces are major taxpayer investments but remain chronically underutilized.
* **Social Fragmentation**: Digital lifestyles and urbanization have eroded casual community interaction, increasing loneliness and weakening social fabric.
* **Friction in Coordination**: Discovering availability or organizing simple meetups is unnecessarily difficult, stifling initiative.

---

### 3. The Solution

**CommonGround** is a utility platform that connects people to public spaces and local gatherings in real-time.

* **Live Map**: Visibility into public space availability.
* **Gathering Tools**: One-tap to organize or join activities.
* **Municipal Dashboard (B2B SaaS)**: Manage spaces, promote events, and access analytics.
* **Privacy-First Design**: Growth through utility, not data extraction.

---

### 4. Market & Scalability

* **Primary Audience**: 25–45-year-olds in urban/suburban areas.
* **Immediate TAM**: B2B SaaS contracts with municipal governments (\~\$50k-\$200k/year/city).
* **Expansion TAM**: Partnerships with universities, corporate campuses, and residential complexes.
* **Path to Scale**: Prove the model in flagship cities like Austin or Portland, then replicate to similar markets.

---

### 5. SDG Alignment

* **SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities & Communities**: Optimizes public infrastructure, reduces urban isolation, fosters social integration.
* **SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption**: Promotes shared use of public goods, reducing need for new construction.
* **SDG 3 – Good Health & Well-being**: Encourages outdoor activity and social connection, combating loneliness and supporting mental health.



This project, including its prototype, slides/presentation, and figures, was submitted to the Devpost Deckathon competition (https://deckathon.devpost.com/
). I plan to further develop it into a production-ready application and focus on engaging local communities early to shape its future, once I have the time.
