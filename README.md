### 1. Market & Revenue

CommonGround monetizes civic infrastructure by transforming underutilized public spaces into engines of engagement and commerce.

* **B2B SaaS Subscriptions**: Annual licenses for cities and universities for analytics and management tools.
* **Transaction Fees**: Minimal processing fee on paid events and ticketing through our platform.
* **Local Commerce Partnerships**: Revenue share from "proximity" promotions with local businesses.
* **Data Insights (Anonymized)**: Selling aggregated space utilization trends to urban planners and developers.

---

### 2. The Problem

Public spaces and community life are constrained by three critical inefficiencies:

* **Inefficient Resource Use**: Parks, libraries, and civic spaces are major taxpayer investments but remain chronically underutilized.
* **Social Fragmentation**: Digital lifestyles and urbanization have eroded casual community interaction, increasing loneliness and weakening social fabric.
* **Friction in Coordination**: Discovering availability or organizing simple meetups is unnecessarily difficult, stifling initiative.

---

### 3. The Solution

**CommonGround** is a utility platform that connects people to public spaces and local gatherings in real-time.

* **Live Map**: Visibility into public space availability.
* **Gathering Tools**: One-tap to organize or join activities.
* **Municipal Dashboard (B2B SaaS)**: Manage spaces, promote events, and access analytics.
* **Privacy-First Design**: Growth through utility, not data extraction.

---

### 4. Market & Scalability

* **Primary Audience**: 25–45-year-olds in urban/suburban areas.
* **Immediate TAM**: B2B SaaS contracts with municipal governments (\~\$50k-\$200k/year/city).
* **Expansion TAM**: Partnerships with universities, corporate campuses, and residential complexes.
* **Path to Scale**: Prove the model in flagship cities like Austin or Portland, then replicate to similar markets.

---

### 5. SDG Alignment

* **SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities & Communities**: Optimizes public infrastructure, reduces urban isolation, fosters social integration.
* **SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption**: Promotes shared use of public goods, reducing need for new construction.
* **SDG 3 – Good Health & Well-being**: Encourages outdoor activity and social connection, combating loneliness and supporting mental health.



This project, including its prototype, slides/presentation, and figures, was submitted to the Devpost Deckathon competition (https://deckathon.devpost.com/
). I plan to further develop it into a production-ready application once I have the time.
